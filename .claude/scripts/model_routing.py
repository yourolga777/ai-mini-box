"""Model routing — task_start banner over the phase x complexity matrix.

The routing *data* and the pure `suggest_model` / `format_suggestion` API live in
`model_routing_matrix` (kept separate for the 400-line filesize gate). This module
re-exports them for back-compat and adds the multi-line task_start banner, which
compares the recommendation against the transcript's active model.

Claude Code does NOT switch models programmatically; the user applies the pick via
the IDE model picker. (`/fast` toggles fast-output on Opus only — not a switch.)
